<p>Each page has riddles and clues that will take you to the next.<br />
You will not be required to write down passwords or remember complicated strings of urls,<br />
but instead have one simple task: discover the path to the next page.
<br /><br />
You are supplied with clues that will give you what you need to reach the next puzzle,<br />
even if they are not apparent at first glance. Sometimes it will require<br />
tinkering or educated guesswork.<br /> <br />That is okay.<br /><br />
<a href="http://notpron.org/notpron/not/level2.htm">Here</a> is a hint as to how you will solve each of these puzzles.</p>
<br /><br /><p>This is an exercise in immersion and discovery. I hope that you enjoy it.<br /><br />
