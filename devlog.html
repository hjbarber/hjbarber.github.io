			Fixing up the "distractions" page. I'm planning on dumping all of the stupid things I work on from time to time in there. "Games" and stuff.</p><hr style="border-top:dotted 1px;" /> <br>

			Got a topnav working that I actually don't hate. Later I'll implement the dropdown functionality, but for now this will do fine. </p><hr style="border-top:dotted 1px;" /> <br>

				"Distractions" will be where I put all the dumb web games I've tried tinkering with. Good luck if you're doing it on mobile. I just need to figure out how I want the "distractions" page to look. I always overcomplicate things. <br><br>It'll for sure be sarcastic as all heck<hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />Â <br>

Got a draft of the thing up. I'm just hosting it with github right now. I wanted to see how it looked on mobile, which I wasn't altogether too happy with. Can I even use javascript on mobile? I never know what runs and what doesn't on a mobile browser. I was really hoping to keep this simple. Guess we'll find out.<br><br>
Okay, the dropdowns are not working like I'd hoped they would on mobile. I'm sure if I were a halfway decent coder, I could've figured it out, but I just didn't feel like spending the effort. I might someday down the road. For now, I'll go with the un-hackiest hack that has ever existed. I'll just ALSO make the topnavs a link. Sorry, everyone. I suck at this.<br><br>
I had been playing around with some glitchy things made purely out of css and clip paths/keyframes, but I will just keep experimenting with that on the side. For now, everything will be static and BORING.<br><br>
Figured I'd try to glitch out some of the homepage. If you're reading this and don't see glitchy stuff, assume I'm doing this now.<br><br>
Okay, got it to work, but I'll need to work later on randomizing it.</p>
