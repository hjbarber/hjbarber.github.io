		<h1>a note on developer logs</h1>
		<p align = "center">I'm the hackiest coder of all time, but I'm also super cheap. I'm about transparency, though, so you'll get to see my process throughout. Here, you'll find only transparency.<br>Developer Logs are where you'll see the changes I'm making to the site in real time. Or as often as I remember to update them. Oh pish posh. <br><hr><hr><br>

<p>2/4/18 <br>
Got a draft of the thing up. I'm just hosting it with github right now. I wanted to see how it looked on mobile, which I wasn't altogether too happy with. Can I even use javascript on mobile? I never know what runs and what doesn't on a mobile browser. I was really hoping to keep this simple. Guess we'll find out.<br><br>
Okay, the dropdowns are not working like I'd hoped they would on mobile. I'm sure if I were a halfway decent coder, I could've figured it out, but I just didn't feel like spending the effort. I might someday down the road. For now, I'll go with the un-hackiest hack that has ever existed. I'll just ALSO make the topnavs a link. Sorry, everyone. I suck at this.<br><br>
I had been playing around with some glitchy things made purely out of css and clip paths/keyframes, but I will just keep experimenting with that on the side. For now, everything will be static and BORING.<br><br>
Figured I'd try to glitch out some of the homepage. If you're reading this and don't see glitchy stuff, assume I'm doing this now.<br><br>
Okay, got it to work, but I'll need to work later on randomizing it.</p>
