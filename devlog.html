Got a draft of the thing up. I'm just hosting it with github right now. I wanted to see how it looked on mobile, which I wasn't altogether too happy with. Can I even use javascript on mobile? I never know what runs and what doesn't on a mobile browser. I was really hoping to keep this simple. Guess we'll find out.</p>
